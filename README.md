<h1> Description for Week 3 workshop </h1>
<br>
<h2> Demo repo made to use merge and create branches </h2>
 </br>
<br>
<p>Different branches for the same repo were made by two different people and the they were merges into the main page.
</br>
 <p> Different conflicts were faced while merging the branches and working on the repo. Main conflicts faced were:</p> 
<ul>
<li> Merge Conflict - Edit-Edit conflict - We tried to make changes on the same line from different branches  which caused a Edit-Edit conflict, which was then solved by deleting one of the less important edit. </li></ul></p>
<p> Here is an image displaying the process and types of merges</p>
